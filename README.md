# Joshbot

**Overview**

Joshbot is a REST-style HTTP/JSON API server that provides a Slackbot interface and a way for administrators to manage connected services. The core tech stack is:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)

**Purpose**

This portfolio project was built to demonstrate my project structuring, coding patterns, testing methodology, and documentation approach. It is by no means complete and I intend to continue extending its capabilities over time. You can find a list of future enhancements and known issues by visiting the [issues section](https://github.com/joshuarwynn/joshbot/issues) of the repo.
